### HOW TO RUN

Just run
```
./start.sh
```

By default it launches 3 containers: chezz_front, chezz_back and redis, first two listening to localhost:8025 and localhost:8026 respectively.

Open your browser on http://localhost:8025


#### Configuration

Any relevant changes can be done by modifying .env.back, .env.front and docker-compose.yml.
